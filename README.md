## World Statistics from 1955 to 2020
This is my final project for information and visualization course. I have used the data from kaggle and
combined two dataset(world statistics and co-ordinates of the capital city of countries) and cleansed 
the dataset.
### Tools used:
    HTML
    CSS
    jQuery
    D3js
## Features:
    -Users can select the year and column(population, density, migration rate..)
     from the dropdowns.
    -It shows scatter plot at first, but user can choose bar graph according to 
     their preference.
    -Hovering on circle on scatter plot shows the size of the data for a 
     particular country.
    -Clicking on the circle will open the yearly data of that country, easy to 
     compare.
    -On the side there is a donut which shows population of the continent, hovering
     on the arcs shows population of the continent.
    -Clicking on the arc shows the statistics of the continent in bar chart, easy 
     to compare countries data for the continent.
