## World Statistics from 1955 to 2020
This is my final project for information and visualization course. I have used the data from kaggle and
combined two dataset(world statistics and co-ordinates of the capital city of countries) and cleansed 
the dataset.
### Tools used:
    HTML
    CSS
    jQuery
    D3js
## Features:
    -Select the year and column(population, density, migration rate..) from the dropdowns.
    -Choose between Scatterplot and bar graph according to the preference.
    -Hover on circle on scatter plot to show the size of the data for a particular country.
    -Click on the circle to open the yearly data of that country, easy to compare.
    -Hover on the arcs to show population of the continent.
    -Click on the arc to show the statistics of the continent in bar chart, easy to compare
